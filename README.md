# ðŸš‚ Train Await ðŸš‚

## About this game

In this game the player has to guide the train to the station but the train tracks are all wrong!

Rotate the train tracks by clicking on them. Once all the train tracks are in place press play to make the train move.

If the train travels a longer distance you get a higher score however, rotating the train tracks too much reduces your score. Try finding the optimal route for the highest score possible.
